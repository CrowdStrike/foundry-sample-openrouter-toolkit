## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- CrowdStrike Falcon platform access
- NGSIEM workbench permissions
- OpenRouter Toolkit installed by platform administrator

### Basic Usage

1. **Access the Toolkit**: Navigate to an incident in the NGSIEM workbench and locate the OpenRouter Toolkit in the details panel

2. **Select Context** (Optional): Choose from automatically detected incident entities like domains, IPs, or file hashes for context-aware analysis

3. **Enter Your Query**: Type your question or analysis request in the query field

4. **Configure Settings**:
   - **Model**: Select your preferred AI model based on task requirements
   - **Temperature**: Adjust response creativity (0.1 for focused, 0.7+ for creative)
   - **Online Search**: Enable web search for current threat intelligence
   - **Provider Priority**: Optimize for throughput, price, or latency

5. **Submit and Review**: Click Submit and review the AI-generated analysis

### Example Workflows

#### **Indicator Analysis**
```
Context: IP address 192.168.1.100 from incident
Query: "Analyze this IP address for potential threats"
Result: Context-aware analysis incorporating incident details
```

#### **Threat Research**
```
Query: "Explain the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055 (Process Injection)"
Online Search: Enabled
Result: Current threat intelligence and detection methods
```

#### **Custom Analysis**
```
Query: "Compare these two malware families and their TTPs"
Temperature: 0.7 (for comprehensive comparison)
Result: Detailed comparative analysis
```

## Configuration Options

### **Model Selection**
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Best for complex reasoning and comprehensive analysis
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: Balanced performance for most use cases
- **Anthropic Claude**: Strong analytical capabilities and nuanced responses
- **Open Source Models**: Cost-effective options for basic queries

### **Advanced Settings**
- **Temperature Control**: Fine-tune response creativity and focus
- **Provider Sorting**: Optimize API calls based on your priorities
- **Online Search**: Enable real-time web research capabilities
- **Context Integration**: Leverage CrowdStrike incident data automatically

### **User Preferences**
Users can configure default settings including preferred models, temperature ranges, and analysis approaches to streamline their workflow.

## Integration Details

### **CrowdStrike Platform Integration**
- **NGSIEM Workbench**: Embedded in incident details panel
- **Context Access**: Automatic extraction of incident entities and metadata
- **Workflow Compatible**: Integrates with CrowdStrike Fusion SOAR workflows
- **Role-Based Access**: Respects existing CrowdStrike permission structures

### **OpenRouter API Integration**
- **Multi-Provider Access**: Single API for multiple AI model providers
- **Optimized Routing**: Automatic provider selection based on preferences
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent request management and retry logic
- **Cost Management**: Transparent usage tracking and optimization

## Security & Privacy

### **Data Handling**
- **No Persistent Storage**: Analysis requests are not retained long-term
- **Secure Transmission**: All data encrypted in transit to OpenRouter
- **Access Controls**: Integrated with CrowdStrike role-based permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete request and response tracking

### **Privacy Considerations**
- **Context Isolation**: Each analysis session is isolated and secure
- **Configurable Sharing**: Control what incident data is included in analysis

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **No Response from Model**
- **Check Model Availability**: Try selecting a different model
- **Verify Connectivity**: Ensure OpenRouter API access is available
- **Review Query Length**: Very long queries may timeout

#### **Context Not Available**
- **Incident Data**: Ensure you're working within an active incident
- **Entity Detection**: Verify incident contains recognizable indicators
- **Permissions**: Confirm access to incident details

#### **Performance Issues**
- **Model Selection**: Larger models may have longer response times
- **Online Search**: Web-enabled queries take additional time
- **Provider Load**: Try different provider priority settings

### **Getting Help**
